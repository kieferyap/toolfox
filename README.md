## What is this site about?
I want it to be a small collection of tools, and pages I could share to friends.\
My local version has a back-end, but the public version will be front-end only, and an SQLite Database.

## Why did you make this site?
I started to job hunt recently (April 2024), and one of the companies I'm applying to is using the ASP.NET framework, so I made this website as a way to practice.

## What's the tech stack?
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, ASP.NET, C#.

## Where are you hosting this?
I'm hosting it for free at: Azure (Free Tier).\
You can access the site here: https://toolfox.azurewebsites.net/

## Can I give code review feedback?
I am currently just starting out with ASP.net, so constructive feedback is very much appreciated!\
You can send your feedback to my gmail, kiefer.yap, with the title, "[Feedback] Toolfox"
